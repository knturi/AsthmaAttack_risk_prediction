# ASTHMA ATTACK PREDICTION: MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH 

This project is part of Nashville Software School part time data science bootcamp final/capstone project. 

## PROJECT PURPOSE:

To build machine learning model to predict asthma attack. I will be using All of Us Research databases, which is an electronic health record data plus survey for this project.

## PROJECT RATIONALE: 

Despite progress in therapeutic approaches, according to CDC about 50% of individuals with asthma continue to experience asthma attack (Asthma exacerbation) every year. Asthma attack is an acute episode of progressively worsening of asthma symptoms. Uncontrolled asthma (episodes of asthma exacerbation) can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life, healthcare cost and burden, and time away from school and work. Predicting when exacerbation may occur with adequate intervention would reduce healthcare burden, save cost, and improve quality of life. However, efficient methods that can help identify personalized risk factors and make early predictions are lacking. The objective of this project is to use machine learning models to better predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and calculate saved healthcare cost. All of Us Research database with about 35,000 asthma diagnosed patients and about 10,000 asthma attack events provide an opportunity to build a prediction model.

## SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES:

We will retrospectively build a cohort of asthma patients and follow them for asthma exacerbation events. Exacerbation events will be defined as those who needed  1)an emergency department visit, or 2) hospitalization. Predictive models will be built using a gradient-boosting-machines framework. We will attempt to predict by healthcare utilization type (emergency and hospitalization). Predictors will be measurement(physical such as BMI and laboratory such as blood cell counts), prescription drugs and socioeconomic indicators from electronic health records and survey of patients. For each outcome, 80% of the dataset serves to train the model and 20% to validate it.

## ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES:

The out come of this project is asthma exacerbation prediction model that is trained and validated on individuals from diverse geography and communities in the US. This work is preliminary and the resulting model will be trained on more data and evaluated on separate data in the future.
